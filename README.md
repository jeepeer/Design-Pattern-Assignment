Jesper Andersson I wanted to try and make an inventory where you could make customizable items. This was my very first time doing an inventory and items you could change so it was very fun but there were some struggles too.

Singleton: ItemAssets.cs, Used it there so that the assets always can be accessed.

Dependency Injection: UIItem.cs, SetInventory(Inventory inv), I think that this is DI(?), It's used so that I can make an inventory using the Inventory Class.

Factory: InventoryManager.cs, CreateRandomItem(), It's and Item that creates a new item with a random shape and color.

Thank you for your time :D
